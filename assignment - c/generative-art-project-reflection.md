#Assignment C
### A short synopsis


- I chose to attempt reinterpreting **Matrix III​** from 1972 by John Whitney Sr. He is an American animator, composer and inventor, widely considered to be one of the fathers of computer animation. I chanced upon a youtube video - *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaarVR1AOvs* explaining how to reverse engineer the work of John Whitney Sr.
- I was interested in the patterns that were the result of overlapping shapes that seemed to weave into by motion. What I particularly love about this aesthetic, is its simplicity and playfulness. The neon lighting/colours used in these fit perfectly with it’s vintage and retro timeline.He also uses shadows and varying speed to accent and highlight the depth of the images and patterns which appear as a result.
- I simply just experiemneted with values to tweak the original code which was almost entirely jacked from Alexander Miller, it enabled me to understand some fundamentals about using sine and cosine parameters within processing.
